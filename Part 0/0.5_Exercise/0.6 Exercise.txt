title 0.6 Exercise

Browser->Server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa

note left of Browser
On submit of the new note, we have spa.js that will 
take the new note from the form, push contents into the list,
re render the list on the page and send the note to the server
end note

Server-->Browser: Responds with a 201 status code

note right of Server
For the server to know what we need to 
do with this new JSON data, we need to make 
sure the request has the correct content-type
header application/json. We handle this with 
js once the form is submitted. No redirects 
are needed. 
end note
